Puppet Master: the Game was an indie game project based on the cult horror series Puppet Master.  The game was developed in Unity3D with the intent to be pitched to Full Moon Studios.  I was the lead coder on it, and did almost all of the code, including movement, jumping, attacks, character switching, health/stamina systems, weapon systems, spawning, etc.  I was involved with the project on and off from March 2013 to January 2014, finishing a demo build that was sent to Full Moon Studios.
