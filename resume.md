## Background

I am a quick and enthusiastic learner and have a wide variety of talents: focusing on programming, interested in design, and with a talent in Art. Iâ€™m very organized, professional, and have a passion for working with the logical structures of code and designing efficient systems.

## Proficiency

I'm a largely self-taught coder who's been learning since 2009.  My primary experience is in C#, but I've worked in AS3 and Bash shell script, and have experience with Javascript, PHP, C, F#, Lisp, and HTML/CSS.  I've worked in a number of platforms and softwares, including Unity3D, Linux (Ubuntu), Amazon Web Services, Emacs, and Visual Studio.

 * Wrote script that could generate random math questions for the range of mathematical operations required while fitting specified parameters to make the questions more or less difficult.
 * Made extensive use of Regular Expressions to check user input for accuracy, allowing for multiple mathematically valid answers to be input for an algebraic question and be considered correct, as well as to analyze incorrect answers to figure out what went wrong.
 * Learned and utilized an in-house scripting language, eventually helping improve its parser and document it.
 * Debugged the program both on desktop and iPad.
